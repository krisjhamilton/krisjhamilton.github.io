### Summary

The purpose of this game is to navigate the character to the water at the top of the level without getting hit by the enemies. Rinse and repeat to progress to the next level.


### Controls
To move the character, simple use the arrow keys on your keyboard.


### Added Functionality

##### Level Progression
* Each time the character reaches the water, the character increases progression towards the next level and is teleported back to the bottom to start again.

##### Levels
* When the 'Level Progression' bar completely fills, the character progresses the next level. As the character progresses through each level, the enemies move faster and faster.

##### Life
* The life bar represents the characters life for the entire game session. Every level you pass, the life bar remains the same as it was on the previous level. When the character life is empty, the game is over and the character will need to start again from level one... Rinse and repeat
